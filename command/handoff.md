Generate a detailed `handoff.md` file in the root of the project. 
Use your current context and conversation history to accurately populate the following sections:

1. **Summary of Decisions Made**: Explain the key architectural, logic, or design decisions taken so far.
2. **Types of Changes**: Describe the nature of the changes made (e.g., refactoring, new features, bug fixes).
3. **Blockers**: List any obstacles, ambiguities, or missing information that hindered progress.
4. **Things Progressed**: List completed tasks, milestones, and successfully implemented features.
5. **Things Yet to be Done**: List the remaining tasks and provide recommended next steps for whoever picks up the work.

Ensure the report is professional, concise, and provides enough depth for a fresh session to resume immediately.
